# Learn more about Momento

## Who we are

Momento's founders have extensive experience with distributed systems and operation of critical services at scale in the cloud. As a company, we firmly believe that a [truly serverless](https://www.gomomento.com/blog/fighting-off-fake-serverless-bandits-with-the-true-definition-of-serverless) model gives the highest level of abstraction over infrastructure issues such as scaling and availability. We want to help developers to become more productive and ship better experiences to their customers. How can we help you? Please connect with us:
